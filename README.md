# WorkShop_Project_Metavers f
This repository was created as part of my final year internship (PFA) at Metacerse. The goal of this workshop is to explore the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), fine-tune them, and apply semantic search techniques such as embeddings and context retrieval from PDFs.
